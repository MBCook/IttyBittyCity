Notes on the road:

The road is designed so that a car is 80% of the width of a lane.
A lane is 26 pixels wide.
So a car should be 20.8 pixels wide.
A car is actually 4 units wide.
So it will be ~5 pixels per unit for this texture.
That makes the textures (rounded) to 13 units square.
But that isn't even, so we'll go with 12 units square. That should look good.

Notes on road types:

When something can be rotated, each increase in number is 90 degrees clockwise

There are a couple of types of road:
	0 is blank (simple ground)
	1 is horizontal road (12x12 units)
	2 is virticle road (12x12 units)
	3-6 are T intersections (12x12 units).	3 points down
											4 left
											5 up
											6 right
	7 is a + intersecion (12x12 units)
	8-11 are corners (24x24 units).			8 is bottom right of a circle
											9 is bottom left of a circle
											10 is top left of a circle
											11 is top right of a circle

For maps numbers are the same except for one part:
	12-14 mean that the tile is part of a larger object (a 2x2).
	12 is for the upper right tile
	13 is the bottom left tile
	14 is the bottom right tile
	the upper-left tile gets the correct number (one of the types above)
